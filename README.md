# UFMG Homework Repository

  This repository is a collection of some code I've written while studying
Computer Science and/or Information Systems in the Federal University of Minas
Gerais - Brazil (UFMG).

  None of this is or has ever been intended for real world use, so please do not expect
it to follow any reasonable coding standards, work properly or be consistent. use
for reference only.

  There are quite a few missing files in some directories because Google Drive
screwed up. I'm in the process of digging through my backups and Gmail threads
to find the missing stuff, but can't guarantee I will find anything.

  Documentation is mostly in Brazilian Portuguese and don't really document a lot.
I will try to add a minimum set of descriptions to make this rep actually useful
for someone, sometime. Maybe.

# How to use this repository

  Honestly? Don't. But there may be some useful references in there, especially
for Computer Science students on their first years. There's code in C, C++, Java,
Verilog, FORTRAN and who knows what more.

  The directory names in root dir try to vaguely describe which course I was
writing this code for. You can use that as a rudimentary guideline.


# DISCLAIMER

There may be some use of open source software within some files, I honestly do not
remember as most of this code is almost ten years old as of the first commit.
